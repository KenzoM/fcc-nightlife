# NightLife Coordination App
A single-web-page app that utilizes `React` and `Node.js` to allow users search local bars near their desired area.

## Getting Started

[Live Demo](https://night-app-life-app-fcc.herokuapp.com/)

The app is based on one of [FreeCodeCamp's challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app).

It meets the following criteria

>User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area

>User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

>User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

>User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

This app was made possible by [Yelp's API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v2/manage_api_keys)
